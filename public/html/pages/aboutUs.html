              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Travel Buddy Finder was founded in 2023 by a group of passionate travelers who had experienced firsthand
                the challenges of finding compatible travel companions. After numerous solo trips and disappointing group
                tours, our founders realized there was a need for a platform specifically designed to connect travelers
                based on their preferences, interests, and travel styles.
              </p>
              <p>
                What started as a small community of friends sharing travel plans has grown into India's leading platform
                for finding travel companions. Today, we're proud to have helped thousands of travelers connect, plan
                trips together, and create unforgettable memories.
